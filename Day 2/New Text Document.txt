Day 2 
of our 7-day hackathon is officially in the books, and Iâ€™m thrilled to share the exciting progress Iâ€™ve made today! ðŸš€ Our efforts were focused on laying the technical foundation for our e-commerce marketplace, and weâ€™re turning our ideas into real, actionable steps. Hereâ€™s what weâ€™ve accomplished so far:

ðŸ”¹Today, we dove deep into defining the key technical aspects of our projectâ€”frontend, backend, and API integrations. Everything is now aligned with our business goals, and weâ€™ve got a clear roadmap ahead.

ðŸ”¹ Sanity CMS Integration Underway
We designed custom schemas to manage products, orders, and customer data. This integration is going to be a game-changer, streamlining operations and making everything more efficient.

ðŸ”¹ API Workflow Mapped Out
We carefully planned out the essential API endpoints for product retrieval, order placement, and shipment tracking. This is a crucial step to ensure our users get the smooth, seamless experience they deserve.

ðŸ’ª With a solid base now in place, weâ€™re excited to see how the marketplace continues to evolve over the next few days. The potential is huge, and weâ€™re just getting started! ðŸš€

ðŸ”– Big Thanks
